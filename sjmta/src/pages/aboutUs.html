<h1><u>About Us</u></h1>
<h2><span style="color: maroon;">History of SJMTA</span></h2>
<span> The South Jersey Music Teachers' Association was founded by Aurelia Bender and  Marjorie Richie in 1967.  Gladys Story was elected as our first President, Trudi Reim as vice-president, and Sylvia Denbo as our first treasurer.  In our first season, eight meetings were held, all but one at the Haddonfield Conservatory of Music.  Guest speakers for the first season included Sylvia Rabinof of the Brevard Music Center, Natalie Hinderas of Temple University, and John Sears of Wanamaker's Music Department, who gave a lecture-recital using a harpsichord supplied by Wanamaker's. <br><br>

By the end of the 1967-68 year, SJMTA boasted 23 members. <br><br>

SJMTA held its first Student Recital in March 1971; 22 students performed at the Haddonfield Conservatory.  The first Teachers' Recital was held in March 1975, with eight teachers performing. <br><br>

Over the years, the SJMTA <a href="COE.html" target="_blank">Calendar of Events</a> has grown. Thanks to a generous bequest from Sylvia Denbo, one of our original members, we have been able to offer a piano Scholarship in her name annually since our 1996-97 season.  Over the years, we have added a Fall Festival, Master Class, Technique Competition/Theory Test, and Student Musicale to our program.  <br><br>

In 2005, SJMTA became an affiliate of MTNA, the Music Teachers National Association.  <br><br>
